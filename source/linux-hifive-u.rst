Running 64-bit RISC-V Linux on SiFive HiFive Unleashed
======================================================

SiFive's `HiFive Unleashed <https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed>`_ is a Linux capable development board featuring the Freedom U540, the industry's first commercially available Linux-capable RISC-V SoC.

It's a very good starting point if you want to get Linux running on a physical chip/board.
Just like with the HiFive1, SiFive provides open source schematics, an Altium Designer PCB project, BOM, and - of course - tooling for the HiFive Unleashed.
